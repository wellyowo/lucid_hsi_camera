Trigger: Introduction
	This example introduces basic trigger configuration and use. In order to
	configure trigger, enable trigger mode and set the source and selector. The
	trigger must be armed before it is prepared to execute. Once the trigger is
	armed, execute the trigger and retrieve an image.
