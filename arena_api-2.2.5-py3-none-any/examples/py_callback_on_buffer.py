Callback: Image Callbacks
	This example demonstrates configuring an image callback for a device. Once a
	callback is registered and the device is streaming, the user-implemented
	print_buffer function will be called. print_buffer will receive the buffer
	with the image and will display the frame id and timestamp of the image
	before returning.
