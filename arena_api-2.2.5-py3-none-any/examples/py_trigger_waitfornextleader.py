Trigger: WaitForNextLeader
	WaitForNextLeader feature uses a first packet of every incoming image to
	inform users that the camera is done integrating. This is an approximation of
	what the Exposure End event does, but it simplifies the process because we
	don't need to start a whole new event channel, and reuses data that has to be
	transmitted already for the purpose of delivering the image to the user.
