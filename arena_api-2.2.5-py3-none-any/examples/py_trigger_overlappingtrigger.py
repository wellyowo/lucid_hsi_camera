Trigger: Overlapping Trigger on Exposure End Events
	This example demonstrates the use of trigger and exposure end events to
	minimize the amount of unused exposure time between images. This is done by
	setting the device to start exposing (or trigger) right when the last
	exposure has just finished (or exposure end event). After receiving each
	exposure end event notification, the next trigger is executed to acquire the
	next image. Once all triggers have executed, the images are retrieved from
	the output queue. This example shows that there is little time between
	triggering images, and that the exposure time is close to the time between
	triggers.
