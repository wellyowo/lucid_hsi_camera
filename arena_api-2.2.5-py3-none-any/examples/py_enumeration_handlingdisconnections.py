Enumeration: Handling Disconnections
	This example demonstrates a multi-threaded approach to handling device
	disconnections. It spawns two threads, each with a different responsibility.
	First, the acquisition thread is responsible for acquiring images when the
	device is connected. Second, the enumeration thread handles disconnections by
	reconnecting the device and notifying the acquisition thread.
