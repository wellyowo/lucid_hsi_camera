Callback: Multithreaded Image Callbacks
	This example demonstrates configuring a callback within a thread. Once the
	thread has been launched, each new image is acquired and the callback is
	triggered to retrieve the image's frame ID. Once the callback function exits,
	the image buffer is requeued. After all images have been acquired, the thread
	exits and memory is cleaned up.
